# Introduction to Molecular Polaritonics

This repository contains a series of assignments to complement material covered in [Introduction to Molecular Polaritonics](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pyrbUankeDs6eXFUa4vroISCxkcq4kAX?usp=sharing).

The goal is to provide and introduce molecular polaritonics to early undergrads.
